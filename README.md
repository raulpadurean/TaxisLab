A taxi company needs an application to manage the orders received.

Each driver has a tablet on which he sees the taxi orders sent by the dispatcher.

Each taxi order has the address where the driver must arrive, the station from which the taxi is called (closest one to the address), the customer's name and any preferences (car model, does he have a puppy), besides that, there is a button with which the driver accepts the order. The first one from that station will be chosen.

The client can register and login.

Each driver has an ID profile (car registration number or call sign), name, surname.

Each driver has a car .A car has model and brand, license plate , car color, car shape (COMBI OR NOT), whether it is carrying animals or not and the station it is currently in.

The application shows the driver the commands sent by the dispatcher

The application shows the driver and the dispatcher in which station and where the driver is in the booth. (distance)

All drivers can register for the same order.
The app chooses the first driver in the station assigned to the order address 

Order example 

UBB from CENTRU STATION
KFC from CENTRU STATION

Centru STATION TAXIS (288, 434, 455) so 3 cars the first being 288.

if 288 wants to go to the UBB order he will be chosen as he is first in the assigned station for the address.

if the station is empty then, it is given to the nearest driver who is not in the station.

The dispatcher can add, edit and delete orders.
